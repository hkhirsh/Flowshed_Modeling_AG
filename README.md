### Description:
This repository contains the data and code used to build increasingly complex models to predict carbonate chemistry (DIC and TA) in the Florida Keys. 

### Contents:

#### 1. Input data files:
* **Flowshed_Modeling_InputData:** This folder includes the data files required to run the code in the modeling pipeline.

#### 2. Scripts to build dataframe and models:
* **Flowshed_Modeling_Pipeline:** This folder icludes the R scripts required to build the final modeling dataframe, create, and run models. 

#### 3. Scripts for figures:
* **Flowshed_Modeling_Figures:** This folder includes the R scripts required to recreate the figures manuscript.
Note, only figures created in R (Figures 1, 4, 5, 6, 7) are included here.
